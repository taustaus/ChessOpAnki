# ChessOpAnki

This is an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) card for studying openings, inspired by [catchouli](https://github.com/catchouli)'s video (thanks!).

I don't have much knowledge about programming (regex was hard), any feedback is welcome.

It looks quite well in [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)

You have to enter the PGN line in the question field, without header or variations. You can create the PGN with [lichess](https://lichess.org/). The "variation separator" file cleans up the lines from lichess studies.

Thanks to [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) and [chessjs](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
