# ChessOpAnki

This is an Anki card for studying openings, inspired by [catchouli](https://github.com/catchouli)'s video (thanks!).

I don't have much knowledge about programming (regex was hard), any feedback is welcome.

You have to enter the PGN line in the question field, without header or variations. You can create the PGN with lichess. The "variation separator" file cleans up the lines from lichess.org studies.

Thanks to [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) and [chessjs](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
