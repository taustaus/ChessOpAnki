# ChessOpAnki

This is an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) card for studying chess openings, inspired by [catchouli](https://github.com/catchouli)'s video (thanks!).

I don't have much knowledge about programming (regex was hard), any feedback is welcome.

It looks quite well in [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android). In question, you have to play the right move or click the button. In answer, you can go through moves and see comments.

You have to enter the PGN line in the question field, without header or variations. It admits simple comments. You can create the PGN with [lichess](https://lichess.org/).

The "variation separator" is a html file that separates the lines from lichess studies, then you can copy in Anki cards line by line.

Thanks to [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) and [chessjs](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
