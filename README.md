# ChessOpAnki

This is an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) card for studying openings, inspired by [catchouli](https://github.com/catchouli)'s video (thanks!).

I don't have much knowledge about programming (regex was hard), any feedback is welcome.

It looks quite well in [AnkiDroid](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android). In question, you have to play the right move or click the button. In answere, you can go through moves

You have to enter the PGN line in the question field, without header or variations. It admits simple comments. You can create the PGN with [lichess](https://lichess.org/). The "variation separator" file cleans up the lines from lichess studies.

Thanks to [chessground](https://github.com/lichess-org/chessground) and [chessjs](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js)
